# **Water-Tracker: A Household Water Usage Tracker**

## **Objective**
The **Water-Tracker** aims to provide an affordable and efficient system for monitoring household water usage. By tracking water levels in real-time and logging data with precise timestamps, it empowers users to make informed water conservation decisions.

---

## **Key Components**
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno): Acts as the main controller.
- **Water Level Sensor** (Analog): Measures water levels in the tank.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connect components securely.
- **Power Supply** (USB): Provides power to the Arduino and sensors.
- **MicroSD Card** (Optional): For additional data logging capabilities.

## **Features**
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Monitors tank water levels every 3 hours.  
   - Displays water level readings instantly in the **Serial Monitor**.

2. **Timestamped Data Logging**  
   - Logs water levels along with precise timestamps:  
     **Day, Date, Time (HH:MM:SS:MS)**.  
   - Outputs data in CSV format for analysis.

3. **Water Usage Insights**  
   - Tracks water consumption patterns to prevent wastage.  
   - Helps users adopt conservation strategies.  

4. **Cost-Effective Solution**  
   - Uses affordable, commonly available components.  
   - Simple to build and set up for anyone with basic electronics knowledge.

## **How It Works**
1. **Sensor Setup:**  
   The water level sensor is placed in the water tank and connected to the Arduino board.  
2. **Analog Signal Processing:**  
   The sensor sends an analog signal based on the water height, which is converted into a digital value (0–1023) by the Arduino.  
3. **Data Logging:**  
   The Arduino timestamps each reading using a timer and logs it to the Serial Monitor. Optionally, data can be logged to an SD card for offline storage.  
4. **Output Format:**  
   Readings are displayed in the format:  
   `Day, Date, Time (HH:MM:SS:MS), Water Level`.

## **Applications**
- **Household Water Conservation:**  
   Helps households track water usage, avoid tank overflows, and minimize wastage.
